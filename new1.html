The core area:  It involves an entirely secured and protected ecosystem that contributes to the preseArvation of landscapes, ecosystems, species and genetic variation.The buffer zone: It encompasses or adjoins the core areas. It is utilized for activities compatible with sound ecological practices that can fortify scientific research, monitoring, training and education.
The transition area:  It is the part of the reserve where the greatest activity is permitted to promote economic and human development that is sustainableThe UNESCO has introduced the designation ‘Biosphere Reserve’ for natural areas to minimize conflict between development and conservation. Biosphere Reserves are nominated by national government which meets a minimal set of criteria under the Man and Biosphere Reserve Program of UNESCO. Globally, there are 686 biosphere reserves in 122 countries, including 20 transboundary sites.
A scheme called Biosphere Reserve is being implemented by the Government of India since 1986, in which financial assistance is given in 90:10 ratio to the North Eastern Region States and three Himalayan states and in the ratio of 60:40 to other states for maintenance, improvement, and development of certain items.
The State Government prepares the Management Action Plan which is approved and monitored by the Central MAB Committee.</font>
